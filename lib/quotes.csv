Frank Slootman,"How do you get your organization to behave with a fail-fast mentality? First, start at the top. Lead by example: quickly and publicly acknowledge your mistakes, and move on. Act matter of fact-ly. I've had to clean up my own messes for everybody to see. Talk about it publicly, what you were thinking at the time, what was learned from it; this signals to the organization that it is okay to make mistakes and openly own them."
Frank Slootman,"You will have numerous jobs, titles, and pay grades over your career, not just between companies but within companies. At each step, be thoughtful and purposeful rather than opportunistic. Sometimes it might be best to take a step backward in title or pay to set up a better path forward. Your peer group will try to influence your career decisions, but be your own person. Steer your own ship. Never put your personal decisions to a vote."
Frank Slootman,"If you don't know how to execute, every strategy will fail, even the most promising ones. No strategy is better than its execution."
Frank Slootman,"Raise your standards, pick up the pace, sharpen your focus, and align your people. You don't need to bring in reams of consultants to examine everything that is going on. What you need on day one is to ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency, and intensity."
Frank Slootman,People lower their standards in an effort to move things along and get things off their desks. Don't do it. Fight that impulse every step of the way. It doesn't take much more mental energy to raise standards. Don't let malaise set in. Bust it up. Raising the bar is energizing by itself.
Frank Slootman,"Leaders set the pace. People sometimes ask to get back to me in a week, and I ask, why not tomorrow or the next day? Start compressing cycle times. We can move so much quicker if we just change the mindset. Once the cadence changes, everybody moves quicker, and new energy and urgency will be everywhere. Good performers crave a culture of energy."
Paul Graham,"Being strong-willed is not enough, however. You also have to be hard on yourself. Someone who was strong-willed but self-indulgent would not be called determined. Determination implies your willfulness is balanced by discipline."
Paul Graham,"At every period of history, people have believed things that were just ridiculous, and believed them so strongly that you risked ostracism or even violence by saying otherwise. If our own time were any different, that would be remarkable. As far as I can tell it isn't."
Paul Graham,"Let's start with a test: Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers? If the answer is no, you might want to stop and think about that. If everything you believe is something you're supposed to believe, could that possibly be a coincidence? Odds are it isn't. Odds are you just think whatever you're told."
Paul Graham,"The recipe for great work is: very exacting taste, plus the ability to gratify it."
Paul Graham,"You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible."
Paul Graham,"If you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself."
Paul Graham,"Paying attention is more important to reliability than moving slowly. Because he pays close attention, a Navy pilot can land a 40,000 lb. aircraft at 140 miles per hour on a pitching carrier deck, at night, more safely than the average teenager can cut a bagel."
Paul Graham,"If you can keep hope and worry balanced, they will drive a project forward the same way your two legs drive a bicycle forward."
Paul Graham,Introducing change is like pulling off a bandage : the pain is a memory as soon as you feel it.
Ayn Rand,The question isn't who is going to let me; it's who is going to stop me.
Ayn Rand,"If you don't know, the thing to do is not to get scared, but to learn."
Ayn Rand,"A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others."
Ayn Rand,"I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine."
Ayn Rand,"I started my life with a single absolute: that the world was mine to shape in the image of my highest values and never to be given up to a lesser standard, no matter how long or hard the struggle."
Ayn Rand,The hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident which everybody has decided not to see.
Ayn Rand,To sell your soul is the easiest thing in the world. That's what everybody does every hour of his life. If I asked you to keep your soul - would you understand why that's much harder?
Joe Rogan,I’m obsessed with extreme winners because I think there’s a madness to it. I truly believe that in order to truly be great at something you have to give into a certain amount of madness.
Joe Rogan,Greatness and madness are next door neighbors and they often borrow each other’s sugar.
Joe Rogan,Excellence in anything increases your potential in everything.
Joe Rogan,We define ourselves far too often by our past failures. That’s not you. You are this person right now. You’re the person who has learned from those failures. Build confidence and momentum with each good decision you make from here on out and choose to be inspired.
Joe Rogan,"Get better at whatever you’re doing. So what if you suck at it now. Everybody sucks at everything when they start. But if you love it, and don’t lie to yourself, then get better at it."
Joe Rogan,There’s only one way to get good at anything; you surround yourself with the bad motherf**kers who are doing exactly what you do and you force yourself to keep up and inspire each other.
Joe Rogan,"Be the hero in your own movie. Pretend that your life was a movie and it started now, what would the hero do? What would the person that you respect do? What would the person that you admire and inspires you do? Do that."
Joe Rogan,Work for that feeling that you have accomplished something… Don’t waste your time on this earth without making a mark.
Joe Rogan,"I realized a long time ago that instead of being jealous you can be inspired and appreciative. It carries more energy to you. That can be an awesome and motivating force that can improve your life if you choose to be inspired and not jealous. One has no benefit whatsoever, the other is an incredible resource for creating momentum and improvement."
Joe Rogan,"If things aren’t going the way you want them to go, then do something about it. Quit talking about your problems and go out and do something to fix them."
Jocko Willink,"When setting expectations, no matter what has been said or written, if substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable—if there are no consequences—that poor performance becomes the new standard."
Jocko Willink,Stop researching every aspect of it and reading all about it and debating the pros and cons of it … Start doing it.
Jocko Willink,"You can’t make people listen to you. You can’t make them execute. That might be a temporary solution for a simple task. But to implement real change, to drive people to accomplish something truly complex or difficult or dangerous—you can’t make people do those things. You have to lead them."
Jocko Willink,There is no growth in the comfort zone.
Jocko Willink,Don’t fight stress. Embrace it. Turn it on itself. Use it to make yourself sharper and more alert. Use it to make you think and learn and get better and smarter and more effective. Use the stress to make you a better you.
Jocko Willink,"There is no easy way. There is only hard work, late nights, early mornings, practice, rehearsal, repetition, study, sweat, blood, toil, frustration, and discipline."

David Goggins,"Always be ready to adjust, recalibrate, and stay after it to become better, somehow, some way."
David Goggins,"If you want to master the mind and remove your governor, you’ll have to become addicted to hard work. Because passion and obsession, even talent, are only useful tools if you have the work ethic to back them up."
David Goggins,We can’t control all the variables in our lives. It’s about what we do with opportunities revoked or presented to us that determine how a story ends.
David Goggins,"Be more than motivated, be more than driven, become literally obsessed to the point where people think you're f**king nuts."
David Goggins,The hero is you.
Elon Musk,"When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."
Elon Musk,"I think it's very important to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better. I think that's the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself."
Elon Musk,There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future?  Making that future a reality is what should drive you.
Elon Musk,You can either watch history happen or be a part of it.
Albert Camus,Live to the point of tears.
Albert Camus,The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.
Albert Camus,"In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer. And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there’s something stronger – something better, pushing right back."
Marc Andreessen,"The world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want, and you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think."
Marc Andreessen,"To do original work, it is not necessary to know something nobody else knows. It is necessary to believe something few other people believe."
Peter Theil,"The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by a crowd; the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve."
Peter Theil,The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.
Peter Theil,People always say you should live your life as if it were your last day. I think you should live your life as though it will go on for ever; that every day is so good that you don’t want it to end.

Jeff Bezos,"Invention is by its very nature disruptive. If you want to be understood at all times, then don't do anything new."
Jeff Bezos,"Work hard, have fun, and make history."
Jeff Bezos,"If you never want to be criticized, for goodness' sake don't do anything new."
Jeff Bezos,"I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, ‘OK, I’m looking back on my life. I want to minimise the number of regrets I have.’ And I knew that when I was 80, I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed, I wouldn’t regret that. But I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day."
Jeff Bezos,"If you decide that you’re going to do only the things you know are going to work, you’re going to leave a lot of opportunity on the table."
Jeff Bezos,"When you receive criticism from well-meaning people, it pays to ask, ‘Are they right?’ And if they are, you need to adapt what they’re doing. If they’re not right, if you really have conviction that they’re not right, you need to have that long-term willingness to be misunderstood. It’s a key part of invention."
Theodore Roosevelt,"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."
Theodore Roosevelt,"It is hard to fail, but it is much worse never to have tried to succeed."
Theodore Roosevelt,"Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty… I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well."
Theodore Roosevelt,The only man who never makes mistakes is the man who never does anything at all.
Theodore Roosevelt,Courage is not having the strength to go on; it is going on when you don't have the strength.

Theodore Roosevelt,"I am an American; free born and free bred, where I acknowledge no man as my superior, except for his own worth, or as my inferior, except for his own demerit."
Theodore Roosevelt,"The things that will destroy America are prosperity at any price, peace at any price, safety first instead of duty first and love of soft living and the get-rich-quick theory of life."
Theodore Roosevelt,"Whenever you are asked if you can do a job, tell 'em, 'Certainly I can!' Then get busy and find out how to do it."
Theodore Roosevelt,Never throughout history has a man who lived a life of ease left a name worth remembering.
Theodore Roosevelt,"No man needs sympathy because he has to work, because he has a burden to carry. Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing."
George Patton,"A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week."
George Patton,Better to fight for something than to live for nothing.
George Patton,The test of success is not what you do when you are on top. Success is how high you bounce when you hit the bottom.
Milton Friedman, Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.
Milton Friedman," There is one and only one social responsibility of business–to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud."
Milton Friedman,"Well first of all, tell me: Is there some society you know that doesn’t run on greed? You think Russia doesn’t run on greed? You think China doesn’t run on greed? What is greed? Of course, none of us are greedy, it’s only the other fellow who’s greedy. The world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests. The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus. Einstein didn’t construct his theory under order from a bureaucrat. Henry Ford didn’t revolutionize the automobile industry that way"

Thomas Sowell,It takes considerable knowledge just to realize the extent of your own ignorance.
Thomas Sowell,I have never understood why it is ‘greed’ to want to keep the money you have earned but not greed to want to take somebody else's money.
Thomas Sowell,"The big divide in this country is not between Democrats and Republicans, or women and men, but between talkers and doers."
Thomas Sowell,It doesn’t matter how smart you are unless you stop and think
Jordan Peterson,"Don’t underestimate the power of vision and direction. These are irresistible forces, able to transform what might appear to be unconquerable obstacles into traversable pathways and expanding opportunities."
Jordan Peterson,"To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order. It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended. It means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality (it means acting to please God, in the ancient language)."
Jordan Peterson,"Strengthen the individual. Start with yourself. Take care with yourself. Define who you are. Refine your personality. Choose your destination and articulate your Being. As the great nineteenth-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche so brilliantly noted, ‘He whose life has a why can bear almost any how."
Jordan Peterson,"You must determine where you are going in your life, because you cannot get there unless you move in that direction. Random wandering will not move you forward. It will instead disappoint and frustrate you and make you anxious and unhappy and hard to get along with (and then resentful, and then vengeful, and then worse)."
Jordan Peterson,"The better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability, rather than status and power. Status you can lose. You carry character with you wherever you go, and it allows you to prevail against adversity."
Jordan Peterson,The successful among us delay gratification. The successful among us bargain with the future.
Jordan Peterson,"Every bit of learning is a little death. Every bit of new information challenges a previous conception, forcing it to dissolve into chaos before it can be reborn as something better. "
Jordan Peterson,"You’re not everything you could be, and you know it."
Jordan Peterson,"You should be better than you are, but it’s not because you’re worse than other people. It’s because you’re not everything you should be."
Jordan Peterson,"Face the demands of life voluntarily. Respond to a challenge, instead of bracing for catastrophe."
Jordan Peterson,"So, listen, to yourself and to those with whom you are speaking. Your wisdom then consists not of the knowledge you already have, but the continual search for knowledge, which is the highest form of wisdom."
Jordan Peterson,"Can you imagine yourself in 10 years if instead of avoiding the things you know you should do, you actually did them every single day—that’s powerful."
Jordan Peterson,The way that you make people resilient is by voluntarily exposing them to things that they are afraid of and that makes them uncomfortable.
Jordan Peterson,"Adopt responsibility for your own well-being, try to put your family together, try to serve your community, try to seek for eternal truth. That’s the sort of thing that can ground you in your life, enough so that you can withstand the difficulty of life."
Jordan Peterson,It’s better to do something badly than to not do it at all.
Ron Swanson,"Never half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing. "
